# Account Tracker

A tool made to spy on a discord account's messages via a webhook & token

## Setup tutorial:

Make sure you have node.js installed (https://nodejs.org/en)

1. Run the install.bat file (this is a 1 time thing)
2. Edit the .env file
3. Run the run.bat file, and you should see a confirmation message from the webhook
4. Now whenever you send, edit or delete a message it will send it to your webhook

Please note: this is made so that you can easily track you activity on discord, and you should not use this on someone without their consent
